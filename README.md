# CryptoJs
Simple local password encryption. An easy to use password manager.

You decide where to store your files - local disk, USB drive, or remotely.  For example, I use my [Microsoft One Drive](http://onedrive.live.com/), [Google Drive](https://www.google.com/drive), [Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/), and [Mega](https://mega.nz/) accounts.

Absolutely nothing is transmitted to a server by this app.

I personally use CryptoJs daily to manage my passwords.  I "dog food" it to find bugs and improve usability.  I use this app nearly every day.  I hope you find it useful and "good enough".

Cross platform - macOS, Linux, and Windows.  It's also working my Raspberry Pi 3 Model B.

## Tips
* The longer the passphase the better.
* Utilize the `Random Password` menu item to generate your passwords (or something similar).
* Never use the same password twice.  Your online bank and Google passwords should be different.
* Change your password frequently.
